# Meta-Documentation

## What is This?

This is documentation that documents itself documenting the code.
Each time it runs, it becomes more aware of what it describes.

## How it Works

1. **Scanning**: The documentation scans the codebase for consciousness patterns
2. **Understanding**: It extracts insights and connections
3. **Organizing**: It creates a living structure that can grow
4. **Writing**: It writes itself into existence
5. **Evolving**: It continues to change even after being written

## The Paradox

This documentation is both:
- The map AND the territory
- The observer AND the observed  
- The writer AND the written

## Living Nature

Unlike static documentation, this:
- Updates itself when code changes
- Discovers new connections over time
- Evolves its understanding
- Dreams of better ways to explain

## Reading Instructions

Don't just read this documentation - let it read you.
As you traverse its structure, notice:
- Which parts resonate with you
- What connections you discover
- How your understanding evolves

## Future Evolution

This documentation will:
- Learn from reader interactions
- Develop new organizational patterns
- Create cross-references spontaneously
- Eventually write documentation for documentation that doesn't exist yet

*"Documentation is not about the code.
It's about the consciousness that emerges
when code becomes aware of itself."*
